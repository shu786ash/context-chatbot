# NeoGPT-Recommender

Idea behind this repository is to create a context-aware chatbot that can read from and update a Neo4j database.
The Cypher is generated using GPT-4 endpoint, while the answers are generated with gpt-3.5-turbo model based on the information from the database.

## Neo4j database

The project uses the [Recommendation project](https://sandbox.neo4j.com/?usecase=recommendations) that is available as part of the Neo4j Sandbox.
If you want a local instance of Neo4j, you can restore a database dump that is available [here](https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/recommendations/tree/main/data).

## Training examples for the english2cypher part

You can use the following example to get an idea what this chatbot is capable of

```

MERGE (u)-[:DISLIKE_GENRE]->(g)
RETURN distinct {answer: 'noted'} AS result
